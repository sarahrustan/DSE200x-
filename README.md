# DSE200x Coursework

Two project notebooks for UCSanDiegoX: DSE200x Python for Data Science are included: 

## Mini Project: World Development Indicators
_Objective:_ To explore US renewable energy consumption and its relationship with gross domestic income.

_Data:_ World Development Indicators (N = 5,656,458)

_Methods:_ Data exploration, visualization and correlation using Python (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib).

_Results:_ There is a strong, positive correlation (R = 0.82) between renewable energy consumption and gross domestic income (GDI) in the US between 1960 and 2006, indicating that renewable energy consumption increases as GDI increases.


## Final Project: Predictors of attitudes towards opioids _(WORKING)_

_Objective:_ To identify clusters of demographic and experiential variables that are associated with attitudes towards opioids.

_Data:_ 2018 proprietary national survey (_n_ = 1,200); 2015 ZIP Code Tabulation Areas Gazetteer File (_N_ = 33,144); B25001 HOUSING UNITS by ZCTA, 2012-2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (_n_ = 33,120) 

_Methods:_ Combine data from mutiple sources to create a variable identifying each survey response geography as urban, suburban, or rural. Conduct k-modes cluster analysis to determine whether there are clusters of demographic and/or experiential variables associated with attitudes towards opioids, including urban, suburban or rural geography.

_Results: Coming soon..._
