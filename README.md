# DSE200x Coursework

Two project notebooks for UCSanDiegoX: DSE200x Python for Data Science are included: 

## Mini Project: World Development Indicators
_Objective:_ To explore US renewable energy consumption and its relationship with gross domestic income.

_Data:_ World Development Indicators (N = 5,656,458)

_Methods:_ Data exploration, visualization and correlation using Python (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib).

_Results:_ There is a strong, positive correlation (R = 0.82) between renewable energy consumption and gross domestic income (GDI) in the US between 1960 and 2006, indicating that renewable energy consumption increases as GDI increases.


## Final Project: Predictors of attitudes towards opioids _(WORKING)_

_Objective:_ Explore survey responses focusing on the relationship between demographics and attitudes towards opioids.

_Data:_ 2018 proprietary national survey (n = 1,200); 2010 US Decennial Census

_Methods:_ Conduct k-means cluster analysis to determine whether there are clusters of demographic and experiential variables, including urban or rural geography, that predict attitudes towards opioids.

_Results: Coming soon..._
